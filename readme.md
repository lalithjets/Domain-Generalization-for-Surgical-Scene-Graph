# Learning Domain Generalization with Graph Neural Network for Surgical Scene Understanding in Robotic Surgeries}

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
- A domain generalized approach on surgical scene graphs to predict instrument-tissue interaction during robot-assisted surgery. We incorporate incremental learning to the feature extraction network and knowledge distillation-based student-teacher learning to the graph network, to accommodate new instruments and domain shifts in the new domain. 
- We design an enhanced curriculum by smoothing (E-CBS) based on Laplacian of Gaussian kernel and Gaussian kernel, and integrate with feature extraction network and visual-semantic graph attention network to improve the model performance. 
- Furthermore, we normalize the feature extraction and graph networkâ€™s logits by T-Norm and study its effect in calibrating the model. 
- The proposed SSU is trained on nephrectomy procedures video frames and then domain generalized to transoral robotics surgery video frames.

## Code Overview
In this project, we implement our method using the Pytorch and DGL library and there are three main folders: 

- `Feature_extractor/`: Used to extract features from dataset images to train the graph network.
- `datasets/`: Contains the dataset needed to train the network.
- `model/`: Contains network models.
- `utils/`: Contains utility tools used for training and evaluation.
- `checkpoints/`: Conatins trained weights

## Library Prerequisities.

### DGL
<a href='https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/install/index.html'>DGL</a> is a Python package dedicated to deep learning on graphs, built atop existing tensor DL frameworks (e.g. Pytorch, MXNet) and simplifying the implementation of graph-based neural networks.
